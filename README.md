Implemented a parser and an interpreter for a new language.
The parser evaluates arithmetic expressions and returns an internal representation for the interpreter.
The interpreter takes the internal representation and executes variable declarations and assignments,
branches and loops, defines and executes functions, classes, and type checking.
The test cases for this project is saved in another repository called "lang-test-cases".
